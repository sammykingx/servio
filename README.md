# 🧰 Servio

> A modern platform that connects **local service providers** (e.g., tailors, event planners, makeup artists, laundry services) to **residents** who need their services — fast, easy, and in one place.

Servio allows users to **plan events and projects** by selecting service categories they need, setting budgets, and receiving offers from relevant service providers.  
Providers can **accept, decline, or renegotiate offers**, making it easy to collaborate without manual sourcing.

**Servio is built with a mission**
> To make local talent more discoverable, trusted, and accessible — one booking at a time.

- **Django backend**: Handles business logic, authentication, and data management.  
- **Tailwind CSS frontend**: For clean, modern, responsive UI.  
- **HTMX (optional)**: Enables lightweight interactivity without full SPA overhead.  
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database.

## 🧭 Core Concepts

### 👤 Users & Providers
- Every provider is also a user.
- A user can be:
  - **Client only** (book services)
  - **Provider only** (offer services)
  - **Both** (e.g., a makeup artist who also books photographers)

### 🏢 Business Profiles
- Store **brand name**, **contact info**, **availability**, **service categories**, and **ratings**.

### 🧭 Availability
- Providers define their **working days** and **hours per day** through a dedicated availability model.

### 🏡 Unified Address Model
- Both user and business addresses live in one table.
- `address_type` distinguishes *residential* vs *business*.
- `is_same_as_business` allows reuse of the same location.

### 📝 Event Creation & Offer Flow
1. User creates an event with required service categories.
2. Providers offering those services receive the request.
3. Providers accept / decline / renegotiate.
4. User selects the providers they want.
5. Booking is confirmed.
